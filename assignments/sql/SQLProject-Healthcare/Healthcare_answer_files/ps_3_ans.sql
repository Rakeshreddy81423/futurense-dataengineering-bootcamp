	Some complaints have been lodged by patients that they have been prescribed hospital-exclusive medicine that they canâ€™t find elsewhere and facing problems due to that.
    Joshua, from the pharmacy management, wants to get a report of which pharmacies have prescribed hospital-exclusive medicines the most in the years 2021 and 2022. 
    Assist Joshua to generate the report so that the pharmacies who prescribe hospital-exclusive medicine more often are advised to avoid such practice if possible
